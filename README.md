# py_DeleteFiles
python Script to delete files by " extension " in a folder

# main_start
This script runs throught the chosen directory, makes a list and then pops the last item.
The idea is to use it when you have several "xxxx_v001" , "xxxx_v002", etc. so the last one stays.
It will print out the list before deleting.

# main_ends
Deletes by extension.
It can also be used to delete by last characters, counting from the extension, example: "xx.xx"
It will print out the list before deleting.
